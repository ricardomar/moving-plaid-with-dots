## Update:
For a final and clean version check [this repository](https://github.com/CIBIT-UC/public_vphysteresis). The repository shares the code used for the stimulus and data analysis of the study "Identification of competing neural mechanisms underlying positive and negative perceptual hysteresis in the human visual system". DOI: [10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117153](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117153)


## Objectives:

- Demonstration of the implementation of bistable moving plaids with dots using Psychophysics MATLAB toolbox.

- Bistable plaids (inward, downward): percepts determined by the movement of the dots.

- In this demonstration several parameters can be customized: gratings spacing, gratings width, gratings velocity, gratings contrast, number of points, velocity of points.

- This is just a simple demonstration. The logic behind this code can be integrated in larger projects.
