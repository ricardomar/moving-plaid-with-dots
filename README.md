## Objectives:

- Demonstration of the implementation of bistable moving plaids with dots using Psychophysics MATLAB toolbox.

- Bistable plaids (inward, downward): percepts determined by the movement of the dots.

- In this demonstration several parameters can be customized: gratings spacing, gratings width, gratings velocity, gratings contrast, number of points, velocity of points.

- This is just a simple demonstration. The logic behind this code can be integrated in larger projects.
